# Lab 8 - Starter

1) In your own words: Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline?

- 1. Use Github actions to run the tests whenever changes are pushed to the repository. 
- 2. Run the tests locally to test whether or not the code should be fixed before pushing to the repository.
- 3. Run the tests at the end to make sure everything is still working correctly. 

2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
- No because end to end is more about user interaction. A unit test would be better for this.
