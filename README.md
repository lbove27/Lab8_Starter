1) In your own words: Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline?

1. Use Github actions to run the tests whenever changes are pushed to the repository. 
2. Run the tests locally to test whether or not the code should be fixed before pushing to the repository.
3. Run the tests at the end to make sure everything is still working correctly.
